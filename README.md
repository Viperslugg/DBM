# **Data Management**

Welcome to this repository. It is primarily focused around managing, transforming data, and automating tasks within a data warehouse. For the data warehouse, I will be using Databricks. For transformation of data, I will be using sql/python/pyspark inside Databricks. 

### **About the data**
The data is [bike store data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database), sourced from Kaggle. It is broken up into 9 tables, making up a relational data model.
